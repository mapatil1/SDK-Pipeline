## Pipeline configuration

The SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline can be configured via the `pipeline_config.yml` file, which needs to reside in the root of a project.
To adjust the SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline to your project's needs, it can be customized on multiple levels. This comprises:
 * the general configuration on the project level,
 * the stage level configurations to set configuration values for specific stages,
 * the step configurations to set default values for steps,
 * and the post action configurations to configure post-build behavior.

 If a property is configured in a step as well as the stage level, the stage level value takes precedence.

### General configuration

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `productiveBranch` | | `master` | The name of your default branch. This branch will be used for deploying your application. Other branches will skip deployment. |
| `projectName` | | `artifactId` from pom | Name of the project |
| `collectTelemetryData` | | `true` | No personal data is collected. For details, consult the [analytics documentation](doc/operations/analytics.md). |
| `unsafeMode` | | `false` | Enable unsafe mode to skip checking environment variables for insecure elements. Only use this for demo purposes, **never for productive usage**. |
| `sharedConfiguration` | | | Path to a shared configuration file which is merged with the project's configuration file. |

#### automaticVersioning
The pipeline can be configured to store release candidates in a nexus repository after they passed all stages successfully. By turning on automatic versioning, one can avoid that multiple builds of a continuously delivered application lead to version collisions in nexus. When activated, the pipeline will assign unique maven versions for each release candidate. If you are not building a continuously delivered application, you will typically disable automatic versioning.
Architectural details of this step can be found in [automatic-release.md](doc/architecture/decisions/automatic-release.md).

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `automaticVersioning` | | `true` | Apply automated versioning scheme. To disable this feature, set the value to `false` |

Example:

```yaml
general:
  productiveBranch: 'master'
  automaticVersioning: true
```

#### features
This section allows to enable or disable certain optional features.
This concept is known as *Feature Toggles*.

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parallelTestExecution` | | `off` | Run E2E Tests in parallel. This feature is disabled by default because it is [not supported](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38442) in Blue Ocean. If this feature is enabled, we suggest not using the Blue Ocean interface and rely on the classic UI instead. |

Example:

```yaml
general:
  productiveBranch: 'master'
  projectName: 'example_project'
  features:
    parallelTestExecution: on
```

#### jenkinsKubernetes
If the Jenkins is running on a kubernetes cluster as a pod, we can use the dynamic scaling feature in the pipeline. In order to enable this, an environment variable `ON_K8S` has to be set to `true` on the jenkins.


| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jnlpAgent` | | `jenkins/jnlp-slave:latest` | Docker image for `jnlp` agent to be used |

In the Jenkins configuration section under `Manage Jenkins` menu, set the value for your environment variable under `Global properties` section.

![Environment variable configuration](images/k8s-environment-config.jpg)

The Jenkins spins up `jnlp` agent nodes on demand. By default, the `jenkins/jnlp-slave` docker image is used. We can also use the custom `jnlp` agent by configuring the same in the `pipeline_config.yml` file as shown below.

```yaml
general:
  jenkinsKubernetes:
    jnlpAgent: jenkins/jnlp-slave:latest
```

#### sharedConfiguration

URL of a shared configuration file.
Useful if many projects require similar or identical confiugration in large parts.
See [`shared-config-between-projects.md`](doc/pipeline/shared-config-between-projects.md) for more details.

### Stage configuration

#### staticCodeChecks

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Please find more details in the [maven plugin documentation for pmd](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/pmd-mojo.html#excludes). |
| `findbugsExcludesFile` | | | Path to a [FindBugs XML exclusion file](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html) relative to the application folder. |

#### unitTests

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerImage` | | `maven:3.6.1-jdk-8-alpine` | The docker image to be used for running unit tests. **Note:** This will only change the docker image used for executing the unit tests. For switching all maven based steps to a different maven or JDK version, you should configure the dockerImage via the mavenExecute step. |

#### backendIntegrationTests

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `retry` | | `1` | The number of times that integration tests will retry before aborting the build. **Note:** This will consume more time for the jenkins build. |
| `forkCount` | | `1C` | The number of JVM processes that are spawned to run the tests in parallel in case of using a maven based project structure. For more details visit the [surefire documentation](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#forkCount). |
| `credentials` | | | The list of system credentials to be injected during integration tests. The following example will provide the username and password for the systems with the aliases ERP and SFSF. For this, it will use the Jenkins credentials entries erp-credentials and successfactors-credentials. You have to ensure that corresponding credential entries exist in your Jenkins configuration |
| `createHdiContainer` | | False | Activates the creation of a HDI containers in CAP projects. The name of the container will contain the project name and a random id. |
| `cloudFoundry` | X** | | The Cloud Foundry target (landscape, org, space, credentials) where the HDI container will be created. Please find the details below.  |

** The parameter `cloudFoundry` is only mandatory if `createHdiContainer` is `true`.

Example:
```yaml
backendIntegrationTests:
  retry: 2
  credentials:
    - alias: 'ERP'
      credentialId: 'erp-credentials'
    - alias: 'SF'
      credentialId: 'successfactors-credentials'
```

The integration tests stage also offers the option to run a sidecar container, e.g. for running a database or another downstream system.
To use this optional feature the following configuration values have to be provided:

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`sidecarImage` | | | Name of the Docker image that should be used. |
|`sidecarName` | | | On Docker: Name of the container in local network. On Kubernetes: Name of the container. |
|`sidecarReadyCommand` | | | Command executed inside the container which returns exit code 0 when the container is ready to be used. |
|`sidecarEnvVars` | | | Environment variables to set in the container. |

*Note: To access the container from your tests use the `sidecarName` as hostname on Docker or `localhost:portOfProcess` on Kubernetes.*

The parameter `cloudFoundry` has to contain the following configuration values:

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `org` | X** | | Cloud Foundry organization |
| `space` | X** | | Cloud Foundry space |
| `apiEndpoint` | X** |  | URL to the Cloud Foundry endpoint. |
| `credentialsId` | X**|  | ID to the credentials that will be used to connect to the Cloud Foundry account. |

** The parameters can either be specified here or globally in the general section.

Example:
```yaml
backendIntegrationTests:
  retry: 2
  credentials:
    - alias: 'ERP'
      credentialId: 'erp-credentials'
    - alias: 'SF'
      credentialId: 'successfactors-credentials'
  sidecarName: 'postgres'
  sidecarImage: 'postgres'
  sidecarReadyCommand: 'pg_isready'
  sidecarEnvVars:
    PORT: 8234
```

#### frontendIntegrationTests

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerImage` | | | The docker image to be used for running frontend integration tests. **Note:** This will only change the docker image used for unit testing in the frontend. For switching all npm based steps to a different npm or chromium version, you should configure the dockerImage via the executeNpm step. |

#### frontendUnitTests

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerImage` | | | The docker image to be used for running frontend unit tests. **Note:** This will only change the docker image used for unit testing in the frontend. For switching all npm based steps to a different npm or chromium version, you should configure the dockerImage via the executeNpm step. |

#### endToEndTests

For the stage `endToEndTests` the same configuration options are available as for the stage `productionDeployment`.

In addition to these options also the following ones are available for end-to-end tests:

It is possible to activate zero downtime deployment in end-to-end tests with the option `enableZeroDowntimeDeployment`.
This will lead to a blue-green-deployment on SCP Cloud Foundry respectively to a rolling update on SCP Neo.
By default this feature is turned off.

Running end-to-end tests can be restricted to the `productiveBranch` with the option `onlyRunInProductiveBranch`.
This might be useful when the end-to-end tests slow down development, and build failure on the `productiveBranch` is acceptable.
By default this feature is turned off.

Additional parameters can be passed for each end-to-end test deployment by specifying _optional_ `parameters` for an application URL.
These parameters are appended to the npm command during execution.
This could be used for example to split the entire end-to-end test scenario into multiple sub-scenarios and running these sub-scenarios on different deployments.
For example, when using nightwatch-api, these scenarios can be defined via annotations in the test descriptions and can be called with the `--tag` parameter as shown in the example below. Another option is to execute the end to end tests with various web browsers, e.g. chrome or firefox.

Example:
```yaml
endToEndTests:
  enableZeroDowntimeDeployment: true
  onlyRunInProductiveBranch: true
  appUrls:
   - url: <application url>
     credentialId: e2e-test-user-cf
     parameters: '--tag scenario1 --NIGHTWATCH_ENV=chrome'
   - url: <application url 2>
     credentialId: e2e-test-user-cf
     parameters: '--tag scenario2 --tag scenario3 --NIGHTWATCH_ENV=firefox'
```

#### npmAudit

This stage uses the [`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) command to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

The pipeline fails if one of the following thresholds is exceeded:

* Zero vulnerabilities of category _critical_
* Zero vulnerabilities of category _high_
* Two vulnerabilities of category _moderate_

In case you audited an advisory, and it turns out to be a false positive, you can mark it as _audited_ by adding its id to the `auditedAdvisories` in the stage configuration.
A false positive in this case is when you are confident that your application is not affected in any way by the underlying bug or vulnerability.

Example:

```yaml
npmAudit:
  auditedAdvisories:
    - 123
    - 124
    - 77
```

**Note:** Do not prefix the id with leading zeros, as this would make the number interpreted as octal.

The pipeline will warn you, if an "audited advisory" is not actually detected in your project.

#### performanceTests

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cfTargets` | | | The list of Cloud Foundry deployment targets required for the performance test stage. |
| `neoTargets` | | | The list of Neo deployment targets required for the performance test stage. |

For details on the properties `cfTargets` and `neoTargets` see the stage `productionDeployment`.

#### s4SdkQualityChecks

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disabledChecks` | | [] | A list of checks which should not be executed. Possible values are: `checkDeploymentDescriptors` (Check for insecure options, such as `ALLOW_MOCKED_AUTH_HEADER` in deployment descriptors), `checkResilience`(Check that application is resilient to faults in the network), `checkServices` (Check that only official APIs are used), `checkFrontendCodeCoverage` (Ensures high frontend code coverage), `checkBackendCodeCoverage` (Ensures high backend code coverage) |
| `jacocoExcludes` | | | A list of exclusions expressed as an [Ant-style pattern](http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns) relative to the application folder. An example can be found below.|
| `threshold` | | | This setting allows the code coverage to be stricter compared to the default values. By default, the pipeline will fail if the coverage is below 65% line coverage (`unstableCoverage`), and will be unstable if it is less than 70% (`successCoverage`). If lower numbers are configured, or this configuration is left out, the default values are applied. |
| `customODataServices` | | | We recommend only using OData services listed in the in [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/). Despite that for using custom business objects you can add those APIs here. |
| `nonErpDestinations` | | | List of destination names that do not refer to ERP systems. Use this parameter to exclude specific destinations from being checked in context of ERP API whitelists. |
| `nonErpUrls` | | | List of URLs that are not defined as destinations. Use this parameter to exclude specific URLs from being checked in context of ERP API whitelists. |
| `codeCoverageFrontend` | | | A map containing the thresholds unstable and failing. If the code coverage is lower than what is configured in unstable, the pipeline result is unstable. If it is lower than what is configured in failing, the pipeline will fail. |

Example:

```yaml
s4SdkQualityChecks:
  disabledChecks: []
  jacocoExcludes:
    - '**/HelloWorld.class'
    - '**/generated/**'
  threshold:
    successCoverage: 85
    unstableCoverage: 70
  customODataServices:
    - 'API_myCustomODataService'
  codeCoverageFrontend:
    unstable: 50
    failing: 45
```

| `preset` | |`36`| Name or numerical ID of Checkmarx preset to be used when scanning this project. When a name (string) is specified, the pipeline will try to discover the corresponding numerical ID via the Checkmarx API. Please also make sure to specify **checkmarxCredentialsId and checkmarxServerUrl in such a case**. For determining available presets in your Checkmarx webclient, go to *Checkmarx -> Management -> Scan Settings -> Preset Manager*. Alternatively, you can determine the numerical ID of your targeted preset by following those guides: [Token-based Authentication](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KC/pages/202506366/Token-based+Authentication+v8.6.0+and+up) and [Get All Preset Details](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KC/pages/222036317/Get+All+Preset+Details+-+GET+sast+presets) |

The MTA projects can make use of the extension files and one can use a Jenkins credential store to inject the credentials during runtime instead of storing them as a plain text in the extension file.
In order to use this feature, use a [JSP style or GString style](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/text/GStringTemplateEngine.html) place holder in the extension file and provide the respective credential id in the `pipeline_config.yml` as shown below.

Please note currently only the Jenkins [Sercret text](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) is the supported format for runtime credential substitution.

```yaml
#pipeline_config.yml
productionDeployment:
  appUrls:
   - url: <application url>
     credentialId: e2e-test-user-cf
  cfTargets:
   - space: 'Prod'
     org: 'myorg'
     appName: 'exampleapp'

        classifier: classes
```

#### whitesourceScan
Configure credentials for [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/) scans.
The minimum required Maven WhiteSource plugin version is `18.6.2`, ensure this in the plugins section of the project `pom.xml` file.

Pipeline will execute `npx whitesource run` for npm projects.
Please ensure that all `package.json` files have a `name` and `version` configured so that it is possible to distinguish between the different packages.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.whitesource</groupId>
    <artifactId>whitesource-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>18.6.2</version>
</plugin>
```

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `product` | X | | Name of your product in WhiteSource. |
| `staticVersion` | | | Overwrites the respective version in the whitesource UI per scan with the staticVersion. Per default for every new version of a pom/package.json a new project will be created in the whitesource UI. To deactivate the creation of new projects and always have a fixed version for each project in the whitesource UI, configure the staticVersion. |
| `credentialsId` | X | | Unique identifier of the `Secret Text` on Jenkins server that stores your organization(API Token) of WhiteSource. |
| `whitesourceUserTokenCredentialsId` |  | | Unique identifier of the `Secret Text` on Jenkins server that stores WhiteSource `userKey` of a user. This is required only if the administrator of the WhiteSource service has enabled additional access level control. More details can be found [here](https://whitesource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WD/pages/417529857/User+Level+Access+Control+in+Integrations+and+APIs).  |

Please note that you can not have a `whitesource.config.json` in your project, since the Pipeline generates one from this configuration.

#### sourceClearScan
Configure [SourceClear](https://www.sourceclear.com/) scans.

**Note:** Please note that the SourceClear stage of this pipeline is not actively maintained anymore. In case of issues, feel free to contribute to this project by opening a pull request.

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `credentialsId` | X | | Jenkins credentials id for the SourceClear API token. See [SourceClear docs for details](https://www.sourceclear.com/docs/jenkins-script/). |
| `config` | | | Additional configuration for the SourceClear agent. The key-value pairs will be added to `srcclr.yml`. |

Please note that your project can't have a `srcclr.yml` file.
The pipeline creates a config file with optimized settings.
If you wish to configure SourceClear, add your config entries as in the example.

Example:

```yaml
sourceClearScan:
  credentialsId: 'SRCCLR_API_TOKEN'
  config:
    vuln_methods_extra_ignored_directories: docs, integration-tests
    scope: compile
```

#### fortifyScan
Configure Fortify scans.

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sscUrl` | X | | URL how your Fortify Software Security Center client can be reached. |
| `fortifyCredentialId` | X | | ID of the credentials (username, password) you want to use for the Fortify Software Security Center. Can be configured in `executeFortifyScan` or here. |
| `fortifyProjectName` | X | | Name of your project in Fortify. |
| `projectVersionId` | X | | ID of your project in Fortify. |


If you wish to configure Fortify, add your config entries as in the example.
For the fine tuning of fortify scan, please refer `executeFortifyScan` configuration.

Example:

```yaml
fortifyScan:
  sscUrl: 'https://fortify.dummy.corp.domain/ssc'
  fortifyCredentialId: 'fortifyCredentialId'
  fortifyProjectName: 'mySampleProject'
  projectVersionId: '12345'
```

#### lint

The lint stage can enforce common coding guidelines within a team.

It supports the SAPUI5 best practices linter which operates on SAPUI5 components.
A component is identified by a `Component.js` file in the directory.

By default, the pipeline does not fail based on lint findings.
If you'd like to enable thresholds for lint, you can it like in this example:

```yaml
lint:
  ui5BestPractices:
    enableES6: true
    failThreshold:
      error: 3
      warning: 5
      info: 7
```

To enable ES6 language features, set the flag `enableES6` to `true` as in the example above.

Since linting is a highly subjective topic, a general purpose pipeline cannot implement all linting tools a development team might want to use as part of the pipeline.
For this reason, the [pipeline extensibility](doc/pipeline/extensibility.md) feature can be used to implement your own linters as part of the pipeline.


#### sonarQubeScan

Configure [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) scans.

This is an optional feature for teams who prefer to use SonarQube. Note that it does some scans that are already done by the pipeline by default.
It will only run on the productive branch because SonarQube supports only a single branch in the free "community" version.
If you require it on multiple branches, please open an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sap/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/issues).

| Property | Mandatory | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectKey` | X | | The project is used to refer your project. |
| `instance` | X | | This property refers to a sonarqube instance, which needs to be defined in the Jenkins. |
| `sonarProperties` | | | The properties are used to configure sonar. Please refer to the example below. |

Example:

```yaml
sonarQubeScan:
    projectKey: "my-project"
    instance: "MySonar"
    sonarProperties:
        - 'sonar.jacoco.reportPaths=s4hana_pipeline/reports/coverage-reports/unit-tests.exec,s4hana_pipeline/reports/coverage-reports/integration-tests.exec'
        - 'sonar.sources=./application'
```
